# twibbon maker project with python ðŸ”¥

This is actually a Twibbon making project for my fanspage yeah
@wibuzone.id / @otakuicons.id but it's dead fp lmao.

it's just not used for a long time. Maybe this is useful for you or being a
learning code for learning how to make Twibbon with Python.

## how to use?
```
create.py <path_your_picture> <your_name> <description>
```

* **example**
```
create.py /album/zerotwo.jpg "natsuya" "pythonic"
create.py /album/zerotwo.jpg "mahiro" "just a weebs"
```

output? like this!

<img src="img/example_result.jpg">


**NOTE**: You must change your picture size to 1000x1000 before input 
your picture to program


# modification

You can remake or modify this program such as changing the default template
in the `img/twibbon.png` folder as you wish and can replace the fonts on
`fonts/font.ttf`

**note:** But you need to change the position of the writing layout in this program. Maybe you can search for Google "how to search for a position in the image"
